What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans: Git gets to know that this folder will be trackd but doesn't do it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area contains the files that we want to commit, i.e.the files that we
want to currently track their changes. The working directory contains the files
that haven't been added for commiting.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

manually?
